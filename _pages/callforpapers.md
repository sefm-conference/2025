## Overview and Scope

The conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and
government, to advance the state of the art in formal methods, to facilitate their
uptake in the software industry, and to encourage their integration within practical
software engineering methods and tools.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of
software engineering and formal methods.

<h4 class="areas">Software Development Methods</h4>
- Formal modelling, specification, and design
- Software evolution, maintenance, re-engineering, and reuse

<h4 class="areas">Design Principles</h4>
- Programming languages
- Domain-specific languages
- Type theory
- Abstraction and refinement

<h4 class="areas">Software Testing, Validation, and Verification</h4>
- Model checking, theorem proving, and decision procedures
- Testing and runtime verification
- Statistical and probabilistic analysis
- Synthesis
- Performance estimation and analysis of other non-functional
properties
- Other light-weight and scalable formal methods

<h4 class="areas">Security and Safety</h4>
- Security, privacy, and trust
- Safety-critical, fault-tolerant, and secure systems
- Software certification

<h4 class="areas">Applications and Technology Transfer</h4>
- Service-oriented and cloud computing systems, Internet of Things
- Component, object, multi-agent and self-adaptive systems
- Real-time, hybrid, and cyber-physical systems
- Intelligent systems and machine learning
- Quantum systems
- HCI, interactive systems, and human error analysis
- Education

<h4 class="areas">Case studies, best practices, and experience reports</h4>

## Paper submission

We solicit two categories of papers:

- **Regular papers** describing original research results, case studies, or surveys, should not exceed *16 pages* (excluding bibliography of at most two pages).
- **Short papers** describing original research results or case studies, maybe in an incubation phase, should not exceed *8 pages* (exculuding bibliography of at most one page).
- **Tool papers** that describe an operational tool and its contributions should not exceed *8 pages*.

Papers must be formatted according to the [guidelines for Springer LNCS papers](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs).
All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. 

Papers can be submitted through Microsoft CMT:
