SEFM is committed to inclusive event experiences, respectful of all participants, and free of discrimination, harassment, bullying, or retaliation. An inclusive and respectful atmosphere is vital to free expression and the open exchange of ideas, serving the main purpose of the events.

## Expected Behavior
We expect all participants in SEFM to:
* Exercise consideration and respect in their speech and actions;
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech;
* Be mindful of their surroundings and of their fellow participants;
* Alert any person of the senior organizing team (local organizers, PC chair, steering committee members, and so on)  if they notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this policy, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable at SEFM is:
* Abuse: Any action directed at an individual that (a) interferes with that person’s participation; or (b) causes that person to fear for their personal safety. This includes threats, intimidation, bullying, stalking, or other types of abuse.
* Discriminatory Harassment: Any conduct that discriminates or denigrates an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, citizenship, nationality, age, sexual or gender identity, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law in the location where the event takes place.
* Sexual Harassment: Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

* unwelcome advances or propositions, particularly when one individual has authority over the other;
* inappropriate touching of an individual’s body;
* degrading or humiliating comments about an individual’s appearance;
* using an activity-related communication channel to display or distribute sexually explicit images or messages.
* Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:
* intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions;
* offensive, degrading, humiliating, harmful, or prejudicial verbal or written comments or visual images related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, age, appearance, or other personal characteristics;
* unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature;

* unwelcome and uninvited attention or contact;
