**Systematic testing for robotic systems** 

Robotic systems form the basis for advances in areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, and transport. A number of areas in which robotic systems are being used are safety-critical and so there is a need for software development processes that lead to robotic systems that are safe, reliable and trusted. Testing will inevitably be an important component.

This talk will describe recent work on automated testing of robotic systems. The work is model-based: it takes as input a state-based model that describes the required behaviour of the system under test. Models are written in either RoboChart, a state-based language for robotics, or RoboSim, a simulation language for robotics. These languages have been given a formal semantics, making it possible to reason about models in a sound manner. This talk will describe how the development of robotic software can be formalised based on such languages and how this can lead to the potential to automate the generation of sound test cases. Such test cases can be used for testing within a simulation and possibly also for testing the deployed system. Testing is systematic since test cases target potential faults.
